=== Use Git on Windows

==== Download Git for Windows

Download and install msysgit from https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=full+installer+official+git

The current release is 1.8.4

==== Download SourceTree

SourceTree is a free Git & Mercurial client for Windows or Mac.

Visit http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ to download and then install.

==== Configure SourceTree

On first startup, SourceTree will ask for user information. Please
filling your full name and email address `yourname@sansitech.com`.

Proceed to `SSH Client Configuration` step. If you have existing SSH
keys in ~/.ssh, you are likely to know what to do. Otherwise, choose the
recommended `PuTTY / Plink` as SSH client.

You might want to click ``Skip test'' on the last step as you do not want
to connect to any hosting services here.

==== Create an SSH Key

1.  Start SourceTree, goto `Tools/Create or Import SSH Keys`.
2.  Click `Generate`, randomly move your mouse cursor in the blank area.
3.  Save your public/private key in a safe place.
4.  Copy the public key shown in the text area. It should be something
like `ssh-rsa AAAA ...`
5.  Login to GitLab, on your profile page, goto `SSH Keys` tab, then add
a new key. Give it a name, past the public key to the text area.
6.  Click `Tools/Launch SSH Agent...`. In your windows taskbar, there
should be an `Pageant` icon. Right click and choose `View Keys` to check
if your key exists. If not, choose `Add Keys` to add the private key you
just saved in step 3.

==== Clone a project from the server

I created a public repo on the server. Visit
http://202.11.20.186/qingpei/git-example to see what's there.

The URL of an repo is shown at the top of it homepage. In this case, the
URL is `git@202.11.20.186:qingpei/git-example.git`.

In SourceTree, click the `Clone/New` button. Paste the repo URL into
`Source Path / URL` field. Choose a destination path on your local
machine to store the copy and clone the whole repo from the server.

Now you have the entire `git-example` repo available locally.
