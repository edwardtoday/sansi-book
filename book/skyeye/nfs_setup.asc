emacs /etc/idmapd.conf
----

Create a shared folder.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir /shared
mkdir /shared/skyeye
chmod 777 /shared/skyeye
chown -R nfsnobody /shared/skyeye
chgrp -R nfsnobody /shared/skyeye
----

Access control.

----
emacs /etc/exports
# add a line
# /shared/skyeye 202.11.0.0/16(rw,sync)
----

Start nfs services.

[source,bash]
----
systemctl start nfs-server.service
systemctl start nfs-lock.service
