==== Install Qt

Download Qt from its http://qt-project.org/downloads[download page].

The current version is `Qt 5.2`.

[source,bash]
----
wget http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/5.2/5.2.0/qt-linux-opensource-5.2.0-x86_64-offline.run
chmod +x qt-linux-opensource-5.2.0-x86_64-offline.run
./qt-linux-opensource-5.2.0-x86_64-offline.run

==== Connect to MySQL databases

===== Build the driver

To connect to a MySQL (or MariaDB, which is mostly compatible) database,
the MySQL driver must be built first.

The following assumes Qt and MySQL are installed to these paths:

* Qt install dir: `~/Qt5.2.0`
* MySQL include path: `/usr/include/mysql`
* MySQL lib path: `/usr/lib64/mysql` (`/usr/lib/mysql` if MySQL
installed is a 32-bit version)

Open a terminal and build the driver:

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/Qt5.2.0/5.2.0/Src/qtbase/src/plugins/sqldrivers/mysql
~/Qt5.2.0/5.2.0/gcc_64/bin/qmake "INCLUDEPATH+=/usr/include/mysql" \
"LIBS+=-L/usr/lib64/mysql -lmysqlclient_r" mysql.pro
make
make install
----

Try the `sqlbrowser` example from Qt Creator to check whether the driver
is working.
