=== Reading Raw Images

- http://www.imagemagick.org/[ImageMagick] supports http://www.imagemagick.org/script/formats.php#supported[most RAW formats] and provides http://www.imagemagick.org/script/api.php#python[Python bindings].
- http://www.graphicsmagick.org/[GraphicsMagick] is the swiss army knife of image processing. GraphicsMagick is originally derived from ImageMagick 5.5.2 as of November 2002 but has been completely independent of the ImageMagick project since then.
- http://www.cybercom.net/\~dcoffin/dcraw/[dcraw] is a raw image decoder written in C supporting http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/#cameras[many cameras].
- http://www.libraw.org/[LibRaw] is a library for reading RAW files obtained from digital photo cameras (CRW/CR2, NEF, RAF, DNG, and others) with http://www.libraw.org/docs/API-overview-eng.html[C++ API].

And the https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5249413/raw/imagemagick.png[result] from ImageMagick:

By default, `dcraw` alters the image brightness which we do not expect. Edit: `dcraw` has an option `-W` to disable auto brightening.

GraphicsMagick uses `dcraw` as a delegate. To change the settings, run `gm convert -list delegate` to find the path of your `delegates.mgk`, add options `-6 -W -o 2` to the line for `dcraw` in that file. `-6` for 16-bit depth, `-W` to disable auto brightening and `-o 2` for Adobe RGB color space. 

ImageMagick uses `ufraw-batch` as the delegate, whose default exposure compensation is set to 0, thus having no issue.

  Your `ufraw-batch` is too old. Update it with `apt-get install ufraw`.
